I decided not to do a Ph.D. and started job search very abruptly in early 2022. This is partly due to financial reasons. Since I'd never thought about industry before, everything on my CV was RA, and zero internship. So one very fair question that I got and keep getting in almost every job interview is "why don't you do a Ph.D.?"[^answer] Here are the real reasons:

[^answer]: If you are also considering quitting, make sure you have a good answer to this. My very personal suggestion is, make sure you *do* get some (good) offers. So your answer can be: "oh you know I do easily get these grad school offers, but I'm no longer interested." That is, convince people that Ph.D. is *within your constraint* and quitting is your *choice*, instead of Ph.D. being *beyond your capability*! The opposite would be: "no I don't like academia", but then the interviewer might see you as an incompetent/failed student.

* Vuillemey's lost regression

* Reproducibility never there
    + 60% replication success rate is considered "relatively high" for experimental papers (Camerer et al., *Science* [2016](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf0918))
    + if you do macro, luck you! 10% is the bar (McCullough et al., *JMCB* [2006](https://doi.org/10.1353/mcb.2006.0061))
        - a seminal example is Reinhart and Rogoff (*AER: P&P* [2010](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.2.573)). Herndon et al. (*Cambridge J. Econ* [2014](https://doi.org/10.1093/cje/bet075)) invalidate the original paper in a very solid way
    + political economy? Maybe an even lower bar (Wiebe, *Research & Politics* [2024](https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680241229875))
        - I've personally looked into this promotion tournament literature as well. You can easily find (many) rawdata errors and/or totally unreasonable summary stat. in Chen and Kung (*QJE* [2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy027)), Kung and Chen (*APSR* Expression of Concern [2023](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055423000060)), Landry et al.

* *p*-hacking is all you need
    + we always see $p = 0.049$ but never see $p = 0.051$ (Brodeur et al, *AER* [2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/app.20150044); *AER* [2020](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20190687))

* Publish or perish
    + only slightly more than half of the graduates from a top 5 school can publish at least one top 5 paper, ~12 years after graduation (Grove and Wu, *AER P&P* [2007](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.97.2.506)) [students admitted in 1989]
    + a median graduate in top 30 US schools publishes ~0 *AER*-equivalent paper, six years after graduation (Conley and Ã–nder, *JEP* [2014](http://doi.org/10.1257/jep.28.3.205)) [students graduating in 1986 - 2000]
    + the acceptance rate in top 5 is 6% (Card and DellaVigna, *JEL* [2013](https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.51.1.144)) [papers submitted in 2012]
    + one top 5 paper boosts up the tenure probability by 80% (Heckman and Moktan, *JEL* [2020](https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.20191574)) [tenure track professors in top 35 schools in 1996-2010]
    + this is even worse for females (Hengel, *EJ* [2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueac032))
